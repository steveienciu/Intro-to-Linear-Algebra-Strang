Chapter 2 dealt with solving linear equations, specifically linear equations that formed a square matrix.

Need to fix the following in the codes:
- fix the user input for the size of the matrix, if user accidentally inputs more than one number the matrix input function picks it up
- add most of the functions in this chapter into a header file since most will probavly need to be used in other chapters
- handling the freeing of memory if there was a memory allocation failure when multiple matrices used. need to fix that in a couple of the programs
