Chapter 2 dealt with solving linear equations, specifically linear equations that formed a square matrix.

Need to fix the following in the codes:
- fix the user input for the size of the matrix, if user accidentally inputs more than one number the matrix input function picks it up (done)
- add most of the functions in this chapter into a header file since most will probavly need to be used in other chapters (done)
- handling the freeing of memory if there was a memory allocation failure when multiple matrices used. need to fix that in a couple of the programs (done)
- add logic in for handling out of bound errors, no division by zero, etc. (done, for the most part)

Could also use structures instead to build matrices so can build them easier and quicker with less code. Later issue though
